                            SpaceCraft is a 3rd perspective multiplayer quest open world game. Where they key objectives
                            are exploring new planets while doing quests.

                            <p>
                                In this project me and 3 other of my classmates worked on a 3D game, where the core
                                mechanics we wanted to implement in the game were multiplayer, saving through the use of
                                databases, as well as user authentication, all whiting a 3D open-world game. Some
                                features were taken out as they were simply too much for the user experience, systems
                                that were taken out were databases and user authentication.
                            </p>

                                In this section I go over some of the systems I explored during the making of this game,
                                I select the topics I found to be most interesting and that I found to be the most
                                challenging.
                            </p>

                            </header>
                            <p>
                                When it came to deciding on how to move on with multiplayer, we chose to use Photon
                                engine to facilitate the process. When it came to connecting all players to lobbies, we
                                decided to go with room creation and joining, thus the player can join any open room on
                                the room list menu, once a player joins all the procedurally generated items are loaded
                                the same based on seeds, this includes the interactable items. The inventory is also
                                shared for all players, as well as when they join. Once an item has collected a photon
                                PunRPC is called to sync everyone's interactable in the current room, this is the same
                                for quests and inventory of the player.

                            <p>
                                For the interaction system, it shoots a raycast with a given range and a layer mask and
                                attempts to find any objects or interactable that are in the intractable layers, and
                                once it finds an object with such layer, it activates its panel and displays the
                                information about the object, here the objects are versatile as they are made using
                                scriptable objects, which allows us to make many more intractable objects, with
                                customizable settings such as time to interact and obvious what it is. Once an
                                interactable object is collected using the selected collection key, the object calls
                                destroy as well as updating the quest system while using the PunRPC attribute. For the
                                inventory system I implemented using a stack-like algorithm, essentially added inventory
                                items and stacked them if there was already one in the inventory, and expanded
                                accordingly to the number of items, all items in this game were minerals, flint, and
                                trees.

                                The quest system is simple but effective, as we didn't necessarily implement a vast
                                amount of quests, but the system can still be expanded to other quests even bosses,
                                although we didn't implement this feature it was in our wishlist for this game. There
                                was also a way for the player to see the active quest and know when they finished it.
