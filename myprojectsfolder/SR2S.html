                            Andrick Mercado is a student at San Diego State University. Their field of expertise is Game
                            Development for different platforms. They are currently working as a research assistant at
                            SDSU, specifically developing an IOS and android application that aims to teach elementary
                            students safe walking behaviors when walking to school.

                                This VR game was made by Andrick Mercado for the San Diego State Research Foundation,
                                specifically for the project called Safe Routes to Schools, all the parts of the game
                                were made by me, with the only exception being the artwork (which was purchased), this
                                game is a first-person VR controlled phone game, where the goal is to educate younger
                                children on walking safety in a realistic world. Some important systems used for the
                                creation of this game are the database/saving, car AI, pedestrian AI, player controller,
                                VR interactions via a single google cardboard button, and glance, personalized feedback.

                                    The car artificial intelligence system was the most complex system implemented in
                                    this game. It needed to detect the player, pedestrians, other cars, and different
                                    intersections that required the car to stop, all while maneuvering through the city.
                                    With these requirements in mind, the car can honk at the player when the player is
                                    in front of it, but only if the player is on the road or crossing pedestrian
                                    intersections at red lights. With all these features already mentioned the objective
                                    of the car was to be as realistic as possible, and this car makes use of indicator
                                    lights as well as brake lights. Some of the code for this system is provided below.

                                    The pedestrian artificial intelligence system was much simpler to implement. It only
                                    needs to traverse through the city by selecting random points around it, all while
                                    avoiding other pedestrians and cars. Besides traveling they were required to follow
                                    safe walking behavior and for this, they needed to interact with the world around
                                    them, stopping lights and all the other intersections in the game.

                                    The database used in this game is made using the firebase API for unity, the data
                                    collected was divided by school grade and sex, in order to analyze the data on
                                    different factors. The use of this API, was to measure the in-game performance of
                                    the players, in other words, we wanted to see if this tool was helping players
                                    improve their walking behavior without forcing or altering the knowledge that they
                                    had prior to playing this tool. Some of the code for this implementation is provided

                                    The player controller is the system in charge of moving the player around this
                                    simulated world. The controller works by making use of the gyroscope sensor, on the
                                    phone to keep track of where the player is looking relative to our game, and the
                                    movement depends on where the player is looking at. When using google cardboard only
                                    has one button, which essentially presses the screen when used, with this in mind
                                    whenever the player holds the button the player will move in the direction they are
                                    looking at.

                                    simulate a real-world that players could use to learn safe walking behavior from the
                                    comfort of their homes, and google cardboard being a relatively accessible product,
                                    we decided to make use of its SDK for this project. An example is shown below of how
