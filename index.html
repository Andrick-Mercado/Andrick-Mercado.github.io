                    <p>why did I choose computer science?</p>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by how things work. I remember being curious about 
                    computers and electronics—not just from a hardware perspective, but how the components communicate 
                    to create a functional product. This curiosity naturally led me to programming, the foundation that 
                    brings all these components to life. As Bill Gates once said, “Software is more important than hardware.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Driven by this curiosity, I pursued a degree in Computer Science to deepen my understanding of how 
                    technology works. I have an insatiable desire to learn, especially when it comes to technology. With
                    the rapid advancements in computing, I’m constantly amazed by how fast modern CPUs can perform computations. 
                    As Markus Persson put it, “The speed at which modern CPUs perform computations still blows my mind daily.” 
                    Staying up-to-date with technology is essential to improving it, and I’m always eager to learn more.

                    </header>
                    <p>
                        I’m a first-generation college student, and my journey hasn’t been easy. To attend school, I would 
                        wake up at 4 AM every day to cross the border from Mexico to the U.S., but my determination to succeed
                        kept me going.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m also a passionate gamer with hands-on experience in building games using Unity. I’m proficient 
                        in multiple programming languages, allowing me to develop large-scale applications on various game 
                        engines like Unreal and Unity.

                    <p>
                        My passion for technology really took off when I got my first video game console. That’s when I 
                        became obsessed with understanding how video games were made. I spent countless hours teaching 
                        myself about the game development industry, learning about the languages and engines used to 
                        create these digital worlds. I’m on a continuous journey of learning, just like I’ve been throughout
                        my life. If something piques my interest and I don’t know how it works, I’m determined to figure it
                        out. That’s why I consider myself a seeker of knowledge.
