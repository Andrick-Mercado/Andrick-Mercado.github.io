                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>why did I choose computer science?</p>
                </header>
                <p>
                    As a kid, I always wondered how things were made, such as how a computer and electronics were made,
                    not just from the hardware perspective but as how the components communicate with each other to make
                    it a functional product, hence the reason I got into programming which is the root that makes
                    everything
                    work in electronics or as Bill Gates himself said: “Software is more important than hardware.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this curiosity in me, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science to further understand
                    how technology works, for anything I don’t understand I want to understand completely, it’s just a
                    big part of me. With so many computer advancements in recent years, “The speed at which modern CPUs
                    perform computations still blows my mind daily.” Markus Persson, and with technology staying up to
                    date is key to improving it.

                        1st-generation college student, but it wasn’t easy because in order for me to even go to school
                        I would wake up at around 4 am every day just to make it in time for school, as I had to cross
                        the border from Mexico to the U.S.

                        Passionate gamer with a knowledge of building games in Unity, as well as a proficient programmer
                        in multiple languages that can help build large-scale applications on different game engines
                        such
                        as Unreal and Unity.

                        It wasn’t until I got my first video game console, that my desire to know how video games were
                        made grew, with this came many hours of self-teaching myself about the game development
                        industry,
                        specifically how they were made and with what languages and engines. I am currently on the goal
                        of learning more, just like I did throughout my life, I see something that interests me and if I
                        don't know how it works, I want to learn how it works, and this is why I’m a knowledge seeker.
